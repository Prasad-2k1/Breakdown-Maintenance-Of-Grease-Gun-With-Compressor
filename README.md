# Breakdown-Maintenance-Of-Grease-Gun-With-Compressor
In the course of this project, we identified deficiencies within the entire system. Subsequently, a comprehensive analysis was conducted to ascertain the root causes of these faults. Remedial measures were devised to address each identified issue, leading to the successful repair of all faults. A thorough servicing of the machine was then carried out to ensure its optimal functioning.

To mitigate the risk of future faults, proactive actions were implemented to prevent their recurrence. Through these precautionary measures, the entire system was meticulously restored to a fully operational state. This systematic approach not only addressed existing issues but also established a framework for ongoing maintenance, promoting the sustained functionality and reliability of the entire system.
